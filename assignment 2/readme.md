//  Assignment for the week is:
// **1** - Create a function that takes an array, an index, and a value as parameters. Inside the function, use the splice method to insert the value at the specified index in the array. Return the modified array.
//**3** - Write a program that uses a while loop to print the first 25 integers.
// **4** - Write a program that uses a while loop to print the first 10 even numbers.
// **5** - Create a function that takes a positive integer as parameter and uses a while loop to calculate and return the factorial of that number.
// **6** - Write a program having an array of numbers if the number is negative it should remove the negative number from the array.
// **7**- Create a function that takes an array of numbers as parameter. Use a while loop to calculate and return the sum of all the numbers in the array.
// **8** - Implement a program that takes a list of temperatures in Celsius as input from the user. Convert each temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula F = (C * 9/5) + 32 and store the converted temperatures in an array. Use a while loop to perform the conversion for each temperature.
